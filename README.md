a picture sharing site

### Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- FIGMA

- To build this particular website we used a tool called **figma**.

- Figma shows the design of the web pages on a desktop and their responive versions on tablets and phones.

- To make this sight responsive we used a coding rule called media queries which act as rules for the page to adapt to different screen sizes. We also implied import rules in the **index.css** file to help with the organization of css.

- We used a lot of 'div' elements to arrange different sections on the site

- Also newer techniques like grid template columns
